### **Overview**  
Welcome to **CodeDAO**, a groundbreaking decentralized platform designed to foster open-source development like never before. CodeDAO empowers developers, funders, and communities by combining AI, DAO governance, and automated milestone-based funding.  

This is **not just a platform**â€”it's a movement to reshape how open-source innovation is incentivized, funded, and managed transparently.

### **How It Works**
1. **Proposal Submission:**  
   Developers submit project proposals, which are preprocessed using AI agents to avoid duplication with existing projects.

2. **Proposal Voting:**  
   Proposals are reviewed and voted upon by a DAO consisting of donors, who have a stake in deciding which projects to fund.

3. **Funding Cycles Controlled by Admin:**  
   The admin initiates and manages funding cycles to organize the platform's operations.

4. **Milestone Creation and Tracking:**  
   - Once a proposal is approved, the admin sets milestones for the project.  
   - Developers submit pull requests (PRs) on GitHub, which are analyzed by a bot.  
   - Upon meeting a milestone, the corresponding funds are **automatically released** to the developer.

### **Why CodeDAO?**
1. **Transparency:**  
   Blockchain records all transactions, ensuring every donor knows where their contributions are going.  

2. **Efficiency:**  
   AI preprocessing eliminates redundant projects, streamlining innovation.  

3. **Decentralized Governance:**  
   DAO voting puts decision-making power directly in the hands of donors.  

4. **Fair Compensation:**  
   Developers receive payments tied to tangible progress, fostering trust and accountability.
